    "The **sklearn.preprocessing** package includes a set of common utility methos and transformer classes for transforming raw features vectors into the **best-fitting** representation for downstream estimators. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Is a scikit-learn approach that rescales each observation to a lenght of 1, which is a unit form in linear algebra\n",
