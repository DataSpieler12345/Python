%Y: returns the year with the century as a decimal number.
%m: returns the month as a decimal number with padded zeros.
%d: returns the day as a decimal number with padded zeros.
%H: returns the hour as a decimal number with zero padding.
%M: returns the minute as a decimal number with padded zeros.
%S: returns the second as a decimal number with zero padding.
