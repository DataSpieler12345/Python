The functions we have shown so far are not all that the calendar module offers. In addition to them, we can use the following classes:

calendar.Calendar - provides methods for preparing calendar data and formatting.
calendar.TextCalendar - used for creating regular text calendars.
calendar.HTMLCalendar - used to create HTML calendars.
calendar.LocalTextCalendar - it is a subclass of the calendar.TextCalendar class. The constructor of this class takes the locale parameter, which is used to return the appropriate names of the months and days of the week.
calendar.LocalHTMLCalendar - is a subclass of the calendar.HTMLCalendar class. The constructor of this class takes the locale parameter, which is used to return the appropriate names of the months and days of the week.
During this course, you already had the opportunity to create text calendars by discussing the functions of the calendar module.

It's time to try something new. Let's take a closer look at the methods of the calendar class.
