    "#### Pre-Processing Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Pre-Processing**: (also known as = Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling) The process of converting or mapping data from the initial \"raw\" form into another format, in order to prepare the data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identify and handle missing values** = **occurs** whenever a data entry is left empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Formatting** = Data from different sources may be in various formats, in different units or in various conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Noirmalization** = (centering/scaling) Different columns of numerical data may have very different ranges, and direct comparison is often not meaningful. Normalization is a way to bring all data into a similar range, for more useful comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Binning** = creates bigger categories from a set of numerical values. Its particularly useful for comparison between groups of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turning Categorical values to numeric variables** = values into numeric variables to make statistical modeling easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, we usually perform operations alon columns, each row of the columns represents a sample, i.e.,a different used car in the database"
