#The code you show me is a shorter solution that uses a private list of weekday names and a private attribute to store the weekday index inside the list. This solution is valid and works correctly. The reason my solution is longer is because it provides detailed comments for each method and explicitly handles error cases in the constructor and in the add_days() and subtract_days() methods.
